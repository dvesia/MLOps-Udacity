# Machine Learning DevOps Engineer 

This repository contains the projects covered during the [Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Udacity program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821).  
During this program, I have developed the DevOps skills needed to automate the various aspects and stages of building and monitoring a machine learning model.  

## Projects: 

### [Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code](https://github.com/dvesia/MLOps-Udacity/tree/main/Customer_Churn)
In this project, I've implemented my learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn.   
The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested).   
The package also has the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).
