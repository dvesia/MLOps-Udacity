# Machine Learning DevOps Engineer 

This repository contains the projects covered during the [Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Udacity program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821).  
During this program, I have developed the DevOps skills needed to automate the various aspects and stages of building and monitoring a machine learning model.  
  
## Chapter 1: Clean Code Principles   
In this chapter I've learned the skills that are essential for deploying production machine learning models.   
- First, I've putted coding best practices on auto-pilot by learning how to use PyLint and AutoPEP8.    
- Then I've have expanded my git and Github skills to work with teams.    
- Finally, I've learned best practices associated with testing and logging used in production settings in order to ensure your models can stand the test of time.

### Project: Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code     
In this project, I've implemented my learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn.   
The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested).   
The package also has the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).
