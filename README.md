# Machine Learning DevOps Engineer 

This repository contains the projects covered during the [Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Udacity program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821).  
During this program, I have developed the DevOps skills needed to automate the various aspects and stages of building and monitoring a machine learning model.
